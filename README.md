Welcome to the Botanical Workshop repository!

Botanical Workshop is a [Botania](https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania) addon that adds random things that wouldn't make sense in vanilla Botania. A large amount of the basic code in this mod is shamelessly poached (and then modified to fit Botanical Workshop) from Botania as per the [Botania License](http://botaniamod.net/license.php).
